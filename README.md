hi !

# I'm Marin Aussant

I'm currently a student at **ESMA Rennes** school specialized in Video game conception and where I developed my interest into **Game Programming** but also into Level Design.

Originally from Normandy in France, I started getting interested in programming at the age of 14, initially in web design, which led me to do a D.U.T. Computer Science. But ever since I was little, I've been fascinated and inspired by the world of video games, and I've had this idea in my head to take part in their creation. I tried out Unreal Engine in middle school, then pygame later on, and then decided to start my adventure in video games with ESMA.

## Programming

Some of the programming skills I learned during my studies :

* Unity
* Unreal Engine
* Phaser
* Python
* Object Oriented Programming
* Etc...


Today, I have a preference for **Unity**, on which I have already completed several projects and which I have mastered particularly well.

I particularly like **gameplay programming**, but I'm also interested in **AI programming** and **procedural generation**.

## Level Design

The other creative field I particularly enjoy is **Level Design**. It's always a pleasure to create new **blocking** to create a new environment, to **guide the player** through our world, and to **show him** what we want to show him.

I've then been able to design several levels on several engines according to the needs of the projects:

- Unity
- Unreal Engine
- Unreal Tournament Editor
- Phaser

## Other

I like to keep up to date with new game engine technologies such as **Unreal Engine** and **Godot**.

I'm also interested in giving meaning to my work through **Narrative Design** linked with **Level Design** for visual staging and storytelling, but also directly through **Game Design** and feel to support a statement or an idea. 

I'm always curious to learn more about space and physics, to discover more artistic trends, new artists and musical universes, and to see new movies.

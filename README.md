# Hey!

Nice to meet you!

##  I'm Louis Celeyron


I’m a **Game programmer and designer**. After working as a freelance for a few years, **since 2022** I teach Game Programming in Rennes, France.

I started making games on RPG maker when I was 9, at 12 I continued my tests and my research on **game design and programming** with software like Multimedia Fusion or Construct.
Overall, I really enjoy discovering game engines and frameworks. Even if I didn't work proffesionnaly on all of them I dabbled with :
- Bevy
- Godot
- Game Maker
- GB Develop
- Pygame
- Etc...

Today I am still prototyping with these softwares and languages, however, I more used to **C++ in Unreal Engine (since 2018)**  or **C# in Unity (since 2016)**.


I have skills in **system, gameplay, and UI/UX programming**, but my real passion is **Tool Programming**, which I started to practice in 2018.

I am a **creative programmer**: I have a real interest about Programming and Design, and I use all theses skills to push the limits of my creativity: I love to prototyping and to create tools that I would use as a Designer.

I love **learning** new material, in various fields, such as, of course, Game Design and Game Programming, but also in science, zoology, cooking, cinema, and more!

I also like organizing events. I was on my school student council for 2 year and I spent more time organizing Game Jams than participating in them!

# Me, Alexandre Riallot

I'm a student at **ESMA Rennes** school in Video game conception and I want to be a **Game Programmer**.

Since childood, I'm passionated by video game and curious by how they work and all the secret they keep in their conception. I discovered the programmation in college and directly loved it. So, in 2022 I wanted to matched these two passion and make my adventure in Video game Programmation at the ESMA school.

In this school I learned a lot of skills in programmation in general like:

* Python
* C++
* Phaser
* Unity
* Unreal Engine
* Etc...

Today, I mostly use **Unity** and **Unreal** Engine to prototype and grind skills in game programmation with a current preference for Unity.

I have skills in **gameplay** and **UI/UX**, and always push my skills to learn new things to improve day by day. I'm also interested in AI programming and Tool programming.

I'm very **curious**, i love discover about new things in programmtion but also in general. So i like to know what people do around me and love to ask question about various thing!

hi !
# I'm Marin Aussant

I'm currently a student at **ESMA Rennes** school specialized in Video game conception and where I developed my interest into **Game Programming** but also into Level Design.

Originally from Normandy in France, I started getting interested in programming at the age of 14, initially in web design, which led me to do a D.U.T. Computer Science. But ever since I was little, I've been fascinated and inspired by the world of video games, and I've had this idea in my head to take part in their creation. I tried out Unreal Engine in middle school, then pygame later on, and then decided to start my adventure in video games with ESMA.


Some of the programming skills I learned during my studies :

* Unity
* Unreal Engine
* Phaser
* Python
* Object Oriented Programming
* Etc...


Today, I have a preference for **Unity**, on which I have already completed several projects and which I have mastered particularly well.

I particularly like **gameplay programming**, but I'm also interested in **AI programming** and **procedural generation**.

I like to keep up to date with new game engine technologies such as **Unreal Engine** and **Godot**. I also like to learn new things about Game Design and Level Design, and I'm always curious to learn more about space and physics, to discover more artistic trends, new artists and musical universes, and to see new movies.

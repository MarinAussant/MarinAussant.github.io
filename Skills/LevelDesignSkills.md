## **Level Design Project I worked on**

### Derayah
> Derayah is an **Exploration Puzzle** game where knowledges are essential, made with **Unity 6** in **2024-2025**.

As programming wasn't very challenging on this project, I decided to concentrate on the **Level Design** and **Narrative Design** of this world.

It was our **graduation project**, on which 8 of us worked together for 9 months. I was able to work with all the departments of a video game development team and develop other skills, notably in **Game Design** and playtest feedback.

### Boarding Chaos (Unreal Tournament 4)
> Boarding Chaos is a **Capture The Flag** map made with **Unreal Tournament Editor** in **2 week** in **2023**.

![Boarding Chaos Map](../Documents/Pictures/mapBoardingChaos.png)


I made the entire map in **blocking**, then used the textures from the base game to **dress it up**, and **managed the placement** of the 2 bases and the various weapons and items.

Boarding Chaos is a Capture The Flag blocking map made for Unreal Tournament 4, featuring **different zones** for the game's various weapons and a wide range of **possible paths**.

### UE5 Blocking Navigation
> This is a project made to learn simple **Blocking** on **UE5** made on **2023**.

![UE5 Blocking Screen](../Documents/Pictures/UE5Blocking.png)

The aim of this exercise was to create interesting navigation in a 3D space using Unreal Engine 5.

I was able to guide the player through perspective, lights, viewpoints, create optional paths and a few money shots.

### Dawn on Skyglow
> Dawn on Skyglow is a **2D Platformer** made with **Phaser 3** in **JavaScript** in **1 month** in **2023**.

![Dawn On Skyglow Gif](../Documents/Gifs/dawnOnSkyglowGif.gif)

I designed the entire game, from **Programming** to **Art**, **Level Design** and **Animation**, playable both on the **keyboard** and the **controller**.

I developed simple mechanics to focus on the **Player Controller**, with the implementation of the **State Pattern**, a **Coyote Jump** and a **Jump Buffer**, to achieve a demanding **Level Design** for the player.

OUAI ADAPTER toutout en gros

## **Team work**

I'm very familiar with team work, a lot of my projects are with **3 or more peoples**. So, I know how important communication is, and always make the maximum to **share informations** with everyone.   
I'm learned about all aspect of video game conception except Sound, so I know what my coworker need in information.  
I'm not afraid to talk to people to know their work and I'm very curious about it!

## **Learning**

I love **learn and discover new stuffs** like technology, techniques, etc... I consider my self a fast learner and love to make research about susbject I just discover, and always want to push my understanding of the software I'm using.
I'm not afraid of failing in thing in just discover and experiment.

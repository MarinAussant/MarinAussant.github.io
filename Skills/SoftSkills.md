# **My General Skills**

I'm in a school where I learn Video game conception in all different aspect, that let me learn a lot of skills in general that I can use in my different project, but you will find here a list of my fields of specialization!

## **Programming Skills**

### **Gameplay programming**

I'm comfortable with **systemic gameplay programming, UI and 3C**, and I love programming features that are primordial or not for a game!  
I know to create behaviour or scriptable object in C# for Unity and flexible component or blueprint for Unreal Engine.  
My work routine in general in Gameplay Programming is to first **prototype** and test various of possibility then restart from zero to make something clean.

### **Hierarchy and architectures**

It's very important for me to have a **clean hierarchy and architecture**, I'm always taking a time before start working to think what I will do and how I will do it. Generaly, after prototyping, I will return to **adjust** my hierarchy and architecture to the problems I've encountered.  
I use very frequently a **child/parent class system** and love to use **delegate** to make thing more flexible. I also learned about **design patern** to improve my programming skills and I'm not afraid of refactoring.

### **Mathematics skills**

I used a lot of maths skills on different project. I have algebra and 3D math skills, I'm familiar with vector maths and the use of maths function.

## **Languages**

### **C#**

C# was the first language I learned and the one I'm the more familiar with. I know how to use most of the **C# features** like attributes, interfaces, delegates, generic methods and etc...

### **C++**

I didn't learned a lot of C++, but I have enough knowledge to read it and modify it. I know the basic principle thing like pointer and header/cpp.  
C++ is a deep languague that I that I want and will learn in the future to increase my skills on Unreal Engine for exemple!

### **Others Languages**


Others languages I know are **Python and JavaScript**.  
I know these languages but didn't use them generaly but know how they work and how to use them.   
I'm also interested to discover and practice more other languages in the future!

## **Game Design**

I studied Game Design during 3 years at the ESMA schools. That's give me good **competence of analysis**  to understand what I see or listen when I'm playing. I love to ask myself on what was the choice behind features in a game and what the game designer wanted with that.  
My game design skills let me to look back on my programmation work to see what is good or not and to think about more possibilty.  
I learned with Game Design, how to make **efficientresearch and documentation**, I like make documentation about the work I did to let people of my teams know how to use my creation.


## **Others Softwares**

During the 3 years in the ESMA schools, I touched and learned about a lot of software. Like **Art and video software** with the Adobe softs and 3D software like Blender and Maya, that I use frequently to make placeholder in my project.
I learned also how to use **Organization software** like Taiga and Teams. I use the google suite very frequently to share documentation.


## **Soft Skills**

### **Team work**

I'm very familiar with team work, a lot of my projects are with **3 or more peoples**. So, I know how important communication is, and always make the maximum to **share informations** with everyone.   
I'm learned about all aspect of video game conception except Sound, so I know what my coworker need in information.  
I'm not afraid to talk to people to know their work and I'm very curious about it!


## **Learning**

I love **learn and discover new stuffs** like technology, techniques, etc... I consider my self a fast learner and love to make research about susbject I just discover, and always want to push my understanding of the software I'm using.
I'm not afraid of failing in thing in just discover and experiment.
